## About me

I was born in the year 1982, so you can do the math... I did my studies in commerce but interrupted them in the first year of my A-levels.  
After working most of the time in physical jobs (slaughterhouse, factory, glass cutter, carpenter, order picker), I was looking for a “quieter” job and above all a job I liked. So I decided to take a short course in IT.  
In 2019, I started a 700-hour web/mobile developer training course, the main language was PHP with the Symfony framework. We had a brief presentation of Javascript and React one week each. This type of training is good for a first step in the field, but as the certification received is not recognized, it's difficult to get recruited.  
I couldn't find a job in 2022, so I looked for another course. I started the CDA Concepteur Developpeur d'Application course, where I learned Java, postgreSql and angular. To finish the course, I had to do a 3-month internship, which I did at CS Group and have been working for them ever since.
My current work is mainly focused on the frontend with React and TypeScript.

## Why blog?

The purpose of this blog is to share what I'm learning and doing, and to use it as a memo. Especially to commit myself to finishing the countdown/timer/hit project. Maybe telling the story of this period will help me, because we start a lot of projects but too few come to fruition.  
The blog will also help me improve my French, as I have syntax and grammar problems. I'll also be doing an English translation as I'm not very fluent, and translating what I've just written will help me.
